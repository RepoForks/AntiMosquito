                        android:text="warning: \nThis app Contains an ultrasonic waves attenuation coefficient that may cause some discomfort and lead to hearing damage or lead to headache. \nAs a result, it is likely to be more troubling to cats, dogs, rats and other creatures with highly-sensitive hearing.\n\nSymptoms like headache and dizziness, and nausea can be experienced with prolonged exposure to ultrasounds of low frequencies, and may cause some discomfort and lead to hearing damage. But to clearly differentiate the extent of impact due to audible and ultrasonic noise needs to be studied. Especially in industrial environment where you have different kinds of machines generating various types of sound, and the level of comfort experienced by human beings when suddenly some machines are switched off (although they were not producing any audible noise) while operating, is clear example of human comfort when ultrasonic noise is not present. \n Infrasound, sometimes referred to as low-frequency sound, is sound that is lower in frequency than 20 Hz or cycles per second, the  limit of human hearing. Hearing becomes gradually less sensitive as frequency decreases, so for humans to perceive infrasound, the sound pressure must be sufficiently high. The ear is the primary organ for sensing infrasound, but at higher intensities it is possible to feel infrasound vibrations in various parts of the body. The study of such sound waves is sometimes referred to as infrasonics, covering sounds beneath 20 Hz down to 0.1 Hz and rarely to 0.001 Hz. People use this frequency range for monitoring earthquakes, charting rock and petroleum formations below the earth, and also in ballistocardiography and seismocardiography to study the mechanics of the heart. Infrasound is characterized by an ability to cover long distances and get around obstacles with little dissipation. In music, acoustic waveguide methods, such as a large pipe organ or, for reproduction, exotic loudspeaker designs such as transmission line, rotary woofer, or traditional subwoofer designs can produce low-frequency sounds, including near-infrasound. Subwoofers designed to produce infrasound are capable of sound reproduction an octave or more below that of most commercially available subwoofers, and are often about 10 times the size."
